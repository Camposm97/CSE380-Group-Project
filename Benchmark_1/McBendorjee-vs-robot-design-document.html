      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

      <p>
        This document describes a game called "McBendorjee Vs Robots", which is
        designed to be a simple, 2D top down game that will be submitted for the
        final project for CSE 380. The game will employ sprite based animations,
        tiled levels, collision detection, AI, resource management, and other
        various 2D game techniques learned throughout the semester.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

      <p>
        McBendorjee Vs Robots will be developed for the Windows Platform using
        the McKilla's Gorilla game engine, which is a bare-bones engine
        developed by
        <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~richard">Richard McKenna</a> for
        rapid prototyping 2D games. DirectX will be used as the underlying
        rendering technology. XACT will be used for all music and sound effects
        management. Artwork will be brutally simple, and so we'll simply use MS
        Paint.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>BACK STORY</h3>

      <p>
        Professor McBendorjee was busy trying to recreate the Wolfie 2D engine
        from scratch using nothing but C and MIPs for his CSE 420 class, when he
        accidentally forgot to give a character array a null pointer reference.
        This led to a catastrophic chain of events that culminated in Professor
        McBendorjee getting his own conscience written into the main character
        sprite. Now he will have to brave the AI robots he was creating to
        escape Wolfie 2D or be forever stuck
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

      <p>
        McBendorjee will have to brave 6 levels, each with 4 rooms a peace.
        McBendorjee will have to brave all the AI Robots he created by
        manipulating their movement so that they step on the various hidden
        bombs laid throughout the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        All The Robots have various AI that vary in terms of complexity. Some
        were designed to mimic player movement, some have predetermined paths,
        others will seek out the player.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>

      <p>
        The game will have a top down perspective, The player can make
        McBendorjee can move up, down, left or right, but not diagonal. He will
        have a baseball bat as a melee weapon which he can hit the enemies with.
        The bat cannot damage the enemies directly, but they will get stunned
        and their behaviors will change after. McBendorjee has 5 hitpoints, if
        he runs out of these it will be gameover. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The map will consist one room that is 32 by 32 tiles. Each level will
        have 4 rooms. Within the room are multiple hidden bombs that player
        cannot see. Each bomb will have 3 square sections around it where the
        bomb is the center of the square. The largest square will have an area
        of 49 tiles, the second square will have an area of 25 tiles, and the
        smallest square will have an area of 9 tiles. If the player is not
        within any of these squares their sprite body will be white. If they are
        within the largest square they will be green, the middle square they
        will be yellow, and the smallest square they will be red. If they step
        on the bomb it will instant game over. They player has an option to mark
        the bomb with a flag for future reference, but this will not have any
        affect on the bomb itself other than for visual reference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within each room will be certain number of enemies. There number of
        enemies will always be equal or less than the number of bombs in the
        room. The enemies will have various behaviors that the player will have
        to manipulate. If an enemy steps on the bomb, they will be destroyed and
        so will the bomb. If an enemy collides with the player, they will take
        take damage and have temporary invincibility frames from taking damage
        from enemies (but not bombs). Enemies will do various amounts of damage.
        Each type of enemy will have various behaviors and responses to being
        hit. The goal is to get all the enemies to step on the bombs. Once that
        has happened, the player needs to step on the end room title to clear the room.
        A level is completed once all 4 rooms have been completed.

      <br />

      <p>
        There will also two types of collideable objects in the room.
        Blocks that can be moved when the player hits them, and blocks
        that can't be moved at all. Moveable blocks will move one tile in the opposite direction they were hit.
        Both McBendorjee and the enemies cannot go through these blocks.
        Blocks can cover the end room title, so be careful! 
      </p>

      <h3>CONTROLS</h3>

      <p>
        This game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Once started,
        use the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>W or UP-ARROW</strong> - Move Up</li>
        <li><strong>A OR LEFT-ARROW</strong> - Move Left</li>
        <li><strong>D OR RIGHT-ARROW</strong> - Move Right</li>
        <li><strong>S OR DOWN-ARROW</strong> - Move Down</li>
        <li><strong>SPACE or LEFT-MOUSE-CLICK</strong> - Melee Attack</li>
        <li>
          <strong>SHIFT or RIGHT-MOUSE-CLICK</strong> - Place a flag on a bomb
          tile
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>P</strong> - Panic Button, Resets the Room to it's original
          state
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ESC</strong> - This pauses the game and presents a pop-up
          window to the player asking them to continue when they are ready. If a
          game is not in progress, ESC does nothing.
        </li>
      </ul>

          button for the user to press when they are ready to play. Upon
          pressing it, a brief scripted sequence is played explaining the back
          story for the game. While playing the message "Press ESC to Skip"
          should be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If pressed, the game
          will jump to the main menu.

        created:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>McBendorjee</strong> - we'll only dress McBegndorjee in his lab
          coat. The color of his lab coat will determine if there are bombs
          nearby so we'll need to make artwork for him in his White, Green,
          Blue, and Red outfits. Each will require animations for:
          <!-- TODO: Maybe some more animations for McBendorjee? -->
          <!-- Do we really need animations for up,down,left, and right?
               Yes, so the user can get a better view of the lab coat B)
               It's orthogonal baby :)
          -->
